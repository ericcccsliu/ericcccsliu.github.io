Hi! I'm Eric, and and I'm currently an undergraduate student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/), pursuing a degree in math and computer science. 

On campus
------
I'm a member (and former co-director) of [Hack4Impact UIUC](https://uiuc.hack4impact.org), a nonprofit dedicated to building technology for social good. As part of Hack4Impact, I've worked in teams to build out 
full-stack web applications for [OpenClimateFix](https://www.openclimatefix.org/), a nonprofit fighting climate change with machine learning, [Coko](https://coko.foundation/), an open-source publishing platform, and [Brink](https://www.brinkapp.co/), an accessible voting guide. 

Off campus
------
I've conducted research as part of the [REU in Software Engineering](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) at Carnegie Mellon University and worked as a quantitative trading intern at [Jane Street Capital](https://www.janestreet.com/) and [Citadel Securities](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/). I'll be working full-time as a quantitative trader after I graduate.

<!-- Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.  -->
